### âš¡ Fun fact

I first wrote some BASIC in 1997 and at least 1-5k lines of code a month ever since, but I always take the time to get in the surf, snowboard, hike, exercise, see concerts, travel the world, and visit all sorts of towns and places in Australia. I never do anything unless I'm multitasking, when watching TV I'm coding or playing a game, when out doing errands or even when coding I'm listening to a podcast or have a streamer on the side, audiobooks are great for driving or falling asleep to, and music is the best for cooking or working for a client.

The only time I am focussed on one thing at a time is when I'm with family or friends, then they have my full attention.

Life is too short to spend most of it doing one thing at a time.
